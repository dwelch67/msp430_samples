You will need the documents and tools mentioned in the top level README
file.

You also will want the datasheet for the specific part you are using.
There is a direct link from the launchpadwiki site to the datasheets
for the parts that were provided.  I am using the 2231 part at the
moment.

The RC clock the chip powers up using is pretty irregular, you dont
want to perform any important timing using it.  There is a section
of the flash where TI puts calibration data, each individual part is
calibrated, and if you put the numbers from flash in the clock control
registers you can get a certain level of accuracy on your clock.  Be
careful if you are doing your own flash programming, to not erase
this factory set memory, you will use the calibration forever.  For
this particular part there is a 1MHZ setting and the addresses are
0x10FF for CALBC1_1MHZ and 0x10FE for CALDCO_1MZ (8 bit locations).
