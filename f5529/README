These are examples for one of the launchpad boards.

My board does not have EZFET_UARTTXD connected to p3.3 so using the
TXD jumper doesnt do any good.  So I have to connect a jumper from
p3.3 to the fet side of the TXD jumper.

uart01 is a 115200 baud example but depending on who is receiving may
have some errors now and again.
uart02 is a 9600 baud example less error.
