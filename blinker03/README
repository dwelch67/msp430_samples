You will need the documents and tools mentioned in the top level README
file.

You also will want the datasheet for the specific part you are using.
There is a direct link from the launchpadwiki site to the datasheets
for the parts that were provided.  I am using the 2231 part at the
moment.

Calibration settings applied to use 1MHz clock.

Timer configured to count up from 0x0000 to 0xFFFF then interrupt.

Upon interrupt it toggles the leds.

The datasheet for the specific part G2231, shows the interrupt vector
table.  TACCR0 CCIFG interrupt is used in this example.
