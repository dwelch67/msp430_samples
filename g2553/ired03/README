This one is primarily to record data for one remote, but also can be
used as a starting point for figuring out things or even as a generic
logic analyzer/recorder, whatever.

I have this old RCA TV from the 1980s.  It has outlasted most of the
TVs my family or I have bought since.  Still going strong and still have
the remote.  From what I remember reading somewhere infra red remotes
started pretty much the year this TV came out, and the protocol on this
one is a bit strange.  Preprogrammed, multifunction, universal remotes
never supported this TV.  So I assume this is some unique, pre-standard,
protocol.  The fear of losing the remote before losing the TV along
with the desire to use one remote lead me to build an ir repeater.  I
have a microcontroller board that receives a popular protocol and
when for example it receives the 1 button, it has an ir transmitter and
it blasts out the code, modulated, for the 1 button that the original
remote used.

Now that I use github and am playing with ir receivers again wanted to
capture/log some of this data here.  This code also provides a starting
point for decoding protocols that have a unique start pattern.  Can
probably use it for the other protocols as well, having a start pattern
makes it a lot easier to know where you are in the stream and insure
that you are capturing it from the beginning.
