this is a gps based clock, gps based time is in theory supposed to be
very accurate.  parses the time out of the data stream, adjusts for
the time zone, and displays it on the sharp display.


    //P1.0 LCD Power Control
    //P1.1 RXD from gps, 9600 in this example
    //P1.2 TXD debug out, if enabled same speed as RXD
    //P1.3 LCD Enable
    //P1.4 SPI CS
    //P1.5 SPI CLK
    //P1.6   led2
    //p1.7 SPI MOSI
