This is a C based version of uart01.  http://mspgcc.sf.net or some other
equivalent toolchain is required.  Using their build instructions I have
had no problems building binutils and gcc from sources.  I dont bother
with gdb, etc.

If available mint and other ubuntu based distros (which is debian based) 
have a msp430 binutils and gcc package that you can apt-get.  I use those
where available.

See my build_gcc repo for building llvm/clang from sources.  The optimized
clang/llvm build appears to work, unoptimized is producing buggy code.  
Will need to do more research, to isolate this.
