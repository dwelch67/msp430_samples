You will need the documents and tools mentioned in the top level README
file.

You also will want the datasheet for the specific part you are using.

See the g2553 README for more information on this setup.



This sample program demonstrates using an ir (infra red) receiver module
in particular the one from sparkfun

http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10266

The way these work is that you supply power and ground, 3.3 or whatever
you are using on your microcontroller, and there is an output pin this
output is the demodulated IR signal.  You ultimately want to decode
this signal by measuring the pulses, each IR command has a different
sequence/encoding.

This example simply demonstrates that it works.  When the receiver
output changes the msp430 changes its led, so normally the led is off
(and the input is normally high if nothing going on).

Decoding will be a future example
