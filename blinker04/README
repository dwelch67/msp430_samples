You will need the documents and tools mentioned in the top level README
file.

You also will want the datasheet for the specific part you are using.
There is a direct link from the launchpadwiki site to the datasheets
for the parts that were provided.  I am using the 2231 part at the
moment.



A combination of blinker02 and blinker03.  Uses an interrupt to toggle
leds once a second.
