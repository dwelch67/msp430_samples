You will need the documents and tools mentioned in the top level README
file.

Also look at the ez430/README for info about the specific microcontroller

Similar to the blinker02 example in the top level directory.  This
example sets the processor clock to the factory calibrated 16Mhz
setting.  Then programs divisors and the timer so that it can change
the led once per second.
