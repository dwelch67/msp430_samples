The launchpad wiki describes a connector you can buy for J4.

The part number for the right angle connector is
mill-max  850-10-006-20-001000

If you remove all of the J3 jumpers disconnecting the host/usb side
of the launchpad board from the msp430 dip chip, you can then plug in
a board like the ones you get with the ez430.  In particular this
subdirectory has to do with the 2012 parts you get in this three pack:

Since the msp430 has chip specific programming and register address
information in the datasheet you will need the 2012 and family datasheet.
